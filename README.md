# Ollama Tic-Tac-Toe AI Battle

A Streamlit-based web application that pits two AI agents against each other in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe using Ollama models.

## Features

- ðŸŽ® AI vs AI Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay
- ðŸ¤– Support for multiple Ollama models
- ðŸŽ¯ Real-time game visualization

- ðŸ”„ Dynamic model selection

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Ollama installed and running locally
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/ollama_tic_tac_toe_agent.git
cd ollama_tic_tac_toe_agent
```

2. Install dependencies:

## How it Works

The application uses the Phidata library to create AI agents powered by Ollama models. These agents take turns analyzing the game board and making moves in a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game state is managed through Streamlit's session state, and the UI is updated in real-time to show the progress of the game.
